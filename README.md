## Project Overview
Whatcha-drinking is an application for indecisive coffee(or non-coffee) drinkers who would like to recieve a recommendation for a drink. Project requirements include use of a CSS framework other than Bootstrap(Whatcha-drinking uses Bulma) and the use of two APIs(used YouTube iFrame and Google Directions APIs).

## Appearance and Functionality 
Upon opening the page, the user is presented with with four options for drinks. These options include cold coffee, hot coffee, cold non-coffee and hot non-coffee. Depending on the button clicked a div will load with information on that kind of drink, including a video loaded by YouTube's iFrame API with how to make these drinks yourself. Located below this div is another button that loads with it that display "See A Map?". After the button is clicked the google map section is loaded with an input form. The user can then input their address and it will give them directions to a coffee shop this group has frequented during the creation of this webiste.
